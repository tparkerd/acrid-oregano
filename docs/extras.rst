R Package
*********

Although the database can be directly accessed via your preferred client, it can
be access via R directly using a small R package knowns as `gwasdbconnector` after
its GitHub repo name. The package can be downloaded directly from GitHub at 
https://github.com/tparkerd/gwasdbconnector.git


Preparation
===========

OS Dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

  # libpq-dev (psql)
  sudo apt-get install libpq-dev  

R Dependencies:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/index.html


.. code-block:: r

  # PostgreSQL 
  install.packages('RPostgres')

Enable library


***************
Web Application
***************

Before development began on the PostgreSQL BaxDB database, some work was done to set up a web application that would eventually connect to the BaxDB backend.  This code can certainly be configured to work with the PostgreSQL database, but it will first require an upgrade to a newer version of ``Flask ~>0.12.3``. The ``models.py`` module can be modified to match the ``models.py`` in the BaxDB code.  The web application code is on `GitHub`_.  The web application code is on adriatic in ``/var/www/GWASdb``.  It can be accessed from within the Danforth Center network at ``adriatic.ddpsc.org`` (click “GWAS Database” on the landing page).

.. note::
  Since the web appliation is in very early development, it may be worth starting from scratch and using a more familiar framework.
